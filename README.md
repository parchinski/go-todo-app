# What is this?

This is a GO web app created using:

- templ
- htmx
- tailwindcss
- xata

It is also my first web app created using GO and I enjoyed the dev experience.

## Startup

Should you wish to try this yourself you will need to have a basic go environment setup in order to proceed.
Then you will need to setup a db with xata and plug in the appropriate .env variables and then run `go run cmd/main.go`.

## Expansion

I might further expand this project if I end up having the free time so stay tuned for personal usage.
